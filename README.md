## Advanced Lane Finding Project

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points

### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

This document is the Writeup for the project. The example images shown here are generated in writeup_plots.ipynb. In order to produce the video, I have cleaned up the code and organized the functions more logically, and put the code in project.ipynb.

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The camera matrix and distortion coefficients are calculated from 20 chessboard images. First, the chessboard corners are found using the function `cv2.findChessboardCorners()`. The points from the images are collected in the list objpoints. After going through all the images, the matrix is calculated by the function `cv2.calibrateCamera()`. (project.ipynb cell #2)

The result is tested by applying the correction to one of the chessboard images, as shown below.

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

A test image from the camera was corrected for the distortion using the function `cv2.undist()` for a demonstration. On the left is the original image, and on the right is the undistorted image.
![alt text][imageUndistCam]

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

The undistorted image is covnerted to a binary image. The first step for the conversion is to convert the color space from RGB to HLS by calling the function `cv2.cvtColor()`. A gradient map is generated by the Sobel function applied to the L (lightness) channel along the x axis. A binary image is obtained by applying thresholds to the x gradient.

Another binary is obtained by applying thresholds to the S (saturate) channel.

A third binary is calculated from the H (hue) channel.

Finally, all the binaries are combined. (project.ipynb cell #3) An example of the binary image is shown below in the following section.

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The perspective transform is calculated by the function `cv2.getPerspectiveTransform()` (project.ipynb cell #4). The function takes the source and destination points. The source points are found from a camera image with the straight lane lines as following.

![alt_text][imagePerspective]

The source points from the image are show in the following table, together with the destination points that I have used.

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 284, 672      | 400, 720      | 
| 603, 444      | 400, 0        |
| 678, 444      | 880, 0        |
| 1035, 675     | 880, 720      |

I have applied the binary transform and the perspective transform to the test images to veryfy the code.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

The transformed binary image is turned into a histogram along the x-axis. The peaks in the histogram gives the locations of the lane lines. Starting from the bottom of the image, the active pixels are identified within small boxes on the left and right. The widths of boxes are 100 pixels, and the height is set to a ninth of the total image height. The boxes are then moved up, with their x coordinates adjusted according to the pixels found in the lower boxes. The process is repeated until the boxes reach the top of the image. (project.ipynb cell #5)

![alt_text][imageBox]

Then I fit two second order polynomials with the pixels for left and right lanes. The fits are shown in the yellow lines in the image shown above.

Once the lanes are found, the moving boxes need not be used because the polynomials can used to find the lane pixels. Therefore starting from the next frame, the previous fits are used for the search. (project.ipynb cell #6)

![alt_text][imagePoly]

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

Given a second order polynomial $$f(y) = Ay^2 + By + C$$, the radius of the curvature can be calculated as following.

$$
R_{curve} = (1+(2Ay+B)^{2})^{3/2}/{|2A|}
$$

This calculation is done by the function `getCurves()` in the cell #5 of project.ipynb.


#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

When the lines are found, the area between the lines are colored and plotted over the original image. Here is an example of the plot with the lanes added. (writeup_plots.ipynb cell #14)

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

The video is created by reading in the project video project_video.mp4, and calling the callable class `ProcImg` for each frame. The class `ProcImg` stores two instances of the class `Line`, which contain the history of left and right lanes. The history of the lanes is store as an exponential moving average, calculated as following.

$$S_t = \textit{w} X_t + (1 - \textit{w}) S_{t-1},$$

where $$S_t$$ is a moving average at time $$t$$, $$\textit{w}$$ is the smoothing constant, and $$X$$ is the value being averaged.

The class also checks if the two lane lines are reasonably parallel to each other. If the check fails, the fits are discarded, old lanes are plotted, and it moves on to the next frame.

Here's a [link to my video result](./output_images/project.mp4)

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

In the project, I have not used the horizontal distance between the lanes. In the simple case of the project video, it did not cause a problem, but in more challenging conditions, using more sanity checks should help stabilizing the solution.
